ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ashley-graham
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning Python so that I can run scripts to engage the APIs of our company's tools. I love learning about automations that enhance employees' experiences of their work.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python and all things "Digital Workplace" such as Okta, Google Workspace, and SaaS management.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: ashley.graham@simpli.fi for work-related matters, or a.marie.gay@gmail.com for side projects.
